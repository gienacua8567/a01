            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong>Aquatic Fitness is defined as activities performed in the water that promote and enhance physical and mental fitness. Aquatic Fitness is typically performed in a vertical position in shallow and/or deep water. There are numerous applications to appeal to a wide variety of participants. &nbsp;</strong><br></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>The water’s unique properties allow the pool to provide an environment for people of all abilities. Buoyancy creates a reduced impact exercise alternative that is easy on the joints, while the water’s resistance challenges the muscles. Water lends itself to a well-balanced workout that improves all major components of physical fitness -- aerobic training, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility and body composition. &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Shallow water programming is performed in waist to chest depth. The feet remain in contact with the pool bottom during most of the workout providing a low impact training option. Deep water programs, on the other hand, are performed in water depths that allow the participant to remain vertical (upright) and yet not touch the bottom. Flotation equipment is utilized to maintain correct alignment and provide a truly non-impact workout.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Just like any other forms of exercises, in order to obtain the most benefits from any exercise program, you must have a F.I.T. program: &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>FREQUENCY: Exercise at least 3 to 5 times a week. Some people exercise 5 to 7 times per week, but we suggest at least one day of rest per week. &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>INTENSITY: Every time you exercise you need to achieve the same intensity level gradually, over weeks, increasing that level to improve your fitness level especially for cardiovascular benefits. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>TIME: When you exercise, the duration of your workout should range from 20 to 60 minutes. For cardiovascular benefits exercise at a moderate intensity level, should be maintained for 20 to 45 minutes. &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>VARY YOUR WORKOUT! The type of workouts you participate in helps to determine the types of benefits you achieve. Because different muscles are used in different activities you should participate in several types physical fitness benefits. There are many types of water exercise classes to address the different physical fitness components. Try getting involved with several different classes, altering your workouts.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Characteristics that are Unique to Exercising in Water&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Gravity&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>The biggest difference between land and water aerobics is the effect of gravity on your body. On land, gravity presses down at 100%. You feel this pressure in your back, hips, knees, and ankles when you perform land aerobic movements such as knee lifts, marching, jumping jacks, and side steps.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>When you perform the same movements in water, you lessen gravity’s force on your body. If you stand in waist-level water, expect to reduce the force by 50%. If you stand in chest-deep water, expect to reduce gravity by 65 to 75%. When you are in deep water (neck-level), you only feel approximately 10% of your body’s weight.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Heart Rate&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Your heart and breathing rates elevate when you exercise. Water aerobics requires slightly slower heart rates than land aerobics.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Muscular Response&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Land aerobics usually include a strength training portion. You may do squats, lunges, pushups, or sit-ups to improve your muscle strength and endurance. On land, your body weight (or the addition of dumbbells) provides the resistance.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>In the water, the resistance property of this environment provides training all the way around your body. Whatever direction you move (or if you lift your arm or leg), you are moving against the water pressure. This medium improves and maintains muscle strength and endurance. Also, dumbbells are used in the water similar to land movements for a gentle alternative to traditional strength training.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Class Structure&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>The structure of water aerobics classes begins with 5 to 10-minute warm-ups that use rhythmic, full-body movements such as walking, ankle touching, knee lifting, and jumping jacks.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>After the warm-up, you might participate in 20 to 30 minutes of continuous cardiovascular and strength exercises such as jogging, dancing, and side movements such as twists or grapevines.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>The aerobic workout is followed by a 5 to 10-minute cool-down to slow your heart rate and then 5 to 10 minutes of flexibility exercises.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Water classes improve flexibility when the body is warm while performing stretches.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Resistance&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Water is 800 times denser than air. The cushioning effect of the water provides both resistance and cushioning not found when exercising on land. The resistance of the water strengthens and tones muscles and affects more of the body when exercising if the water is chest-deep or higher. &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Energy Spent and Weight Loss&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Due to the resistance of the water, participants in water aerobics expend more energy than participants in a land-based class when the intensity levels are equivalent.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Land-based aerobics participants had a higher heart rate than water aerobics participants, due to the effect of gravity on the body and hydrostatic pressure during exercise. &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Even with a greater expense of energy, you may not see a significant difference in the amount of weight or fat you lose, according to a study published in the “Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness.” Participants in both the land and water-based groups lost weight and body fat, and both groups saw a decrease in body measurements and skinfold when the exercises were comparable for intensity, duration, and frequency.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Joint Impact&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Aerobics in a pool protects and cushions the joints during exercise because it is an extremely low-impact exercise. This is a benefit of aquatic exercise.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Aerobics in some land settings may provide low-impact exercises, such as dancing, rebounding and walking, but you do not have the cushioning protection that water provides.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>One of the benefits of aquatic exercise is the improved range of motion. The buoyancy offered by the water reduces the effect of gravity and allows your joints more range of motion. If you have joint damage and/or range of motion issues, water aerobics may offer a better alternative for your fitness goals.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Fitness Level&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Students of various ages, abilities, and physical conditions can benefit from water aerobics.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>If you have severe low blood pressure, an infectious disease, open sores, allergies to chlorine or compromised breathing, water aerobics may not offer the best option.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>If water makes you anxious because you can’t swim or have a fear of drowning, choose a land-based aerobics class.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Bone Density and Osteoporosis&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Studies indicate that both forms of exercise in water and on land show improvements to an individual’s bone density rating relating to osteoporosis. &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>When an individual is increasing muscle tension through their joints, the body will help develop stronger connections. This, in turn, increases bone density. &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>On land, gravity is an important factor in increasing bone density through walking, squatting, and other weight-bearing activities.  Although land exercise has been said to have a larger effect on bone density, recent studies have shown improvements in osteoporosis through water exercise. &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>It is wise for an individual to participate in both land and water exercise at least 2 times per week. Use land exercise to focus on balance, strength training, and flexibility using resistance through weights or resistance bands.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><strong>Water can be utilized for aerobic exercise due to its supportive properties and safety features to decrease the risk of falling and muscle strain.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>
